What Works
-The program can take in an input, and ensure the entered input is valid within the given range of 1-95, and multiple of 5 for AU$
-The program can calculate and return the coins for entered value, ensuring it returns the maximum number of higher valued coins first.
-The program prints out the returned coins, printing only the coins which have a count.
-The program will prompt the user to input a value to continue or exit the program, and ensures it does either only when the correct value is entered.

What does not work
-The program does not validate for characters/strings when inputting for amount
-The program does not prompt the user to re-enter an integer for the amount value, when the user inputs a float value. It only rounds off the float input.
-The currency selection prompt does not warn the user or prompts them to re-enter a value when they enter a float number.
